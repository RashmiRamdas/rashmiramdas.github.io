      <strong>Interpreter:</strong> Traditionally, JS engines started by interpreting JavaScript code,
      meaning they executed the code line-by-line or statement-by-statement without compiling it
      fully ahead of time. This allows for quick startup and immediate execution but can be
      inefficient for code that runs repeatedly.

      <strong>JIT Compiler:</strong> Modern JS engines (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox,
      or JavaScriptCore in Safari) use JIT compilation to improve performance. They start by
      interpreting the code but monitor which parts of the code run repeatedly (such as inside loops).
      Those frequently executed parts are then compiled into optimized machine code at runtime.
      This avoids repeatedly interpreting the same code and speeds up execution significantly
      by running compiled code for repeated operations.

      including the concepts of monitoring code execution, baseline compilation, and advanced optimization,
