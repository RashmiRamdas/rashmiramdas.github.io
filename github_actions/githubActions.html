  <h1>GitHub Actions Overview</h1>
  <p>
    GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform integrated directly into GitHub. 
    It enables the automation of software development workflows, including building, testing, and deploying code.
  </p>
  <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Workflows:</strong> Automated processes defined in YAML files within the <code>.github/workflows</code> 
      directory of a repository. They are triggered by specific events, such as a push to a branch, a pull request, or a scheduled time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Events:</strong> Actions are triggered by events occurring in a repository. Examples include <code>push</code>, 
      <code>pull_request</code>, <code>issue_comment</code>, or <code>schedule</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Jobs:</strong> A set of steps that execute on the same runner (a virtual machine or container). 
      Jobs can run in parallel or sequentially and can have dependencies on other jobs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Steps:</strong> Individual tasks within a job. A step can be a shell script or an action.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Actions:</strong> Reusable units of code that perform a specific task. They can be custom-created, 
      found on the GitHub Marketplace, or provided by GitHub. Actions can be written in JavaScript or packaged as Docker containers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Runners:</strong> The environments where jobs execute. GitHub-hosted runners provide a variety of 
      operating systems and software, while self-hosted runners allow for custom environments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Job Execution and Dependencies</h2>
  <p>
    By default, if you define multiple jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow, and they do not have explicit dependencies on each other using the 
    <code>needs</code> keyword, they will run in parallel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each job will execute on its own runner (either GitHub-hosted or self-hosted) and independently of other jobs in the workflow.
  </p>

  <h2>Matrix Strategy for Parallel Job Variations</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>strategy.matrix</code> feature allows you to run the same job multiple times, each with a different set of input variables. 
    This effectively creates multiple parallel
